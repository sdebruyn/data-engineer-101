# Data Engineer 101

When I started as a data engineer, I found it hard to know what you need to know. Which tools will you spend most of your time with? Which programming languages? What is the landscape?

I've built this website mainly for myself for future reference, but it might also be useful to you if you're new to data engineering. Use it to look something up, find alternatives for the tools that you already use or go through to all of it to find interesting things you've maybe never used.

Contribute what you think is missing, I'm open to PRs.
