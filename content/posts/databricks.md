Databricks was founded by the original creators of Apache Spark at the University of Berkeley, California. Databricks provides Spark as a managed service with very useful extra features like support for Jupyter notebooks. Databricks itself offers workspaces that run on AWS. The exact same product is also available as Azure Databricks, running as a native Azure service.
